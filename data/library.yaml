    name: Albert Camus

      of a rich ophthalmologist. Camus is entry in the Communist Part in 1934 was
      mostly due to the increase in fascism in Europe, as he was entrusted with the
      responsibility of doing propaganda work among the Muslims. However, his association
      with the Communist party could not be sustained, and by 1935 he felt a sense
      of disillusionment. Therefore, he invested all his creative energies into the

      that further led to his bizarre ideas. He posited that this state can only exist
      if God is absent.
